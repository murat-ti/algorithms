This solutions are not about ideal developer, it is all about my thinking way and problem solvity ability. 
If you look for 100% solution you are in wrong place, but if you want know more about me, welcome).

When I have free time between projects, I decide to test myself. I solve different tasks and remember algorithms from university.

All solutions are on PHP, because codility does not support Dart yet.

I am sure there is no limit of geniousity and each algorithm can be improved. So some algorithm can be improved with time.

Thanks.
